         Notes is a notetaking app developed by Apple.
         It is provided on their iOS and macOS operating systems,
         the latter starting with OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion. 
         It functions as a service for making short text notes, 
         which can be synchronised between devices using Apple's iCloud service. Wikipedia
